        <h1>How I Created My Generative Art</h1>
        
        <h2>My Creation</h2>
        <img src="https://im-01.gifer.com/91As.gif" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            In my Generative Art Web Page, I created it using both HTML and Javascript.  It is based on my love for potatoes, as it also has a goal 
            of allowing the user to click on the screen in order to plant potatoes in the dirt shown on the background scenery, including a 
            detailed sky, grass, and rocks in the soil.  It is a piece of art I created myself, and it contains my own art style and impressions 
            of potatoes that were executed to be interactive and fun using the requirements of the project in Javascript.
            
        </p>
        
        <h2>How The Project Works Overall</h2>
        
        <h3>Programming Software and Language</h3>
        <p class="p">
            Overall, my Generative Art page functions with HTML, which is referenced to a Javascript file, a coding programming language that is 
            most commonly used to create interactive art within web browsers.  This allows the programmer to type up commands and code that the 
            computer can translate into a language that it understands.  Basically, a coding, or programming, language is a series of syntax rules 
            that can explain how code should be written and presented.  The language a computer uses and understands is binary code, which is code 
            made up of combinations of 0s and 1s that would take eons and an extremely advanced human mind to write out.  Therefore, we use several 
            different coding languages that we understand and can easily create, with certain languages made for certain purposes.  When we write 
            a certain command, it is first translated into assembly language, which is a low-level programming language for a computer, meaning it 
            is closer to the binary language a computer understands, unlike the high-level language mostly used today.  Then, the assembly language 
            is translated into machine language, a set of instructions that is executed directly by the CPU, the computer's central processing unit, 
            into binary code so that the computer can understand the code.
        </p>
        
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/HTML.svg/1200px-HTML.svg.png" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            In this case, I only used HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language, to create the website itself.  Simply put, HTML is a code that is used to 
            write and construct each and every page on the Internet.  It is constantly evolving and getting modified to meet the requirements of 
            the world and its advances, so it is always improving.  HTML consists of several short codes known as tags, which are known to be in 
            between angle brackets (<,>).  These tags allow us to easily put content into webpages and sites, since they are easy to understand 
            and can be written pretty quickly.  Each tag has a different, specific function, and the tags themselves don't appear on the page, but 
            their effects on the content do.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <img src="https://www.slickedit.com/images/stories/products/slickedit/screenshots/2014/beautify-while-typing.gif" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            I used Javascript to add certain content into the website to make it interactive and animated.  I also used the Processing Javascript 
            file (Processing.js) to allow web browsers to display the animations, visual applications, games and other graphical content.  Javascript is a 
            scripting language mainly used on the web to enhance HTML pages and HTML code.  It is the reason web pages are able to be interactive 
            and reactive to certain actions.  These actions are made possible with the use of Javascript functions, which is a block of code that 
            performs a certain action or represents a certain value using commands, conditions, keywords, parameters, and more.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Code Specifics</h2>
        
        <h3>Javascript Functions and Commands</h3>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Ellipses</h4>
            <img id="image3" src="https://developer.tizen.org/sites/default/files/users/user-1451/raph_0033.png" height="200px"/>
            <p>
                The ellipse command creates ellipses, or circles and ovals, in the display window.  They are one of the most common shapes used to 
                create other figures and art, like I did for my generative art when making the potatoes and rocks.  To call the ellipse function, 
                write the word <em>ellipse</em>, followed by a set of parentheses, which contain the parameters.  The first parameter represents 
                the <em>x</em> value of the center point of the ellipse, and the second parameter represents the <em>y</em> value of the center 
                point of the ellipse.  The third parameter represents the width of the ellipse and the fourth represents the height.  To create a 
                perfect circle, both the third and fourth parameters, the width and height, must be equal.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>For Loops</h4>
            <img id="image2" src="https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/java-script-while-loop.gif" height="200px">
            <p>
                The for loop function allows commands to repeat a certain amount of times.  To call a for loop, type the word <em>for</em>, 
                followed by a set of parentheses.  In the parentheses are three parts separated by semicolons: the initialization, the conditional, 
                and the update.  The initialization defines the variable, the conditional controls how many times the loop is executed, and the 
                update represents the increment or decrement.  After this is the code block consisting of the statements that are to be looped in 
                the curly brackets.  The loop continues until the conditional executes to be false.  When the conditional is true, however, then 
                the following statements are executed and looped.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Conditional Statements</h4>
            <img id="image2" src="https://www.javatpoint.com/images/core/if1.png" height="250px"/>
            <p>
                Conditional statements, also known as if-else statements, allow the program to execute blocks of code under certain cicumstances.  
                To call an if-else statement, type the word <em>if</em>, followed by a set of parentheses containing a condition, which is a 
                statement that must be true or false, like <em>x > 20</em>, for example.  After this is a code block, which only runs when the 
                condition is true.  If the condition is false, then the codeblock will not run.  However, if the conditional statement has an 
                <em>else</em> part as well, then the codeblock in curly brackets following the <em>else()</em> will be executed.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>
                You can make your own functions to be able to rewrite the function more than once without having to write all of the code again.  
                This can be done by creating commands and properties that come together to create something.  Then, if you want to duplicate these 
                commands to make a copy of the creation on the display screen, you can put it into a function by calling it with a keyword 
                that appropriately represents it and add <em>= function</em>, followed by a set of parentheses and curly brackets, which contain 
                the commands.  Finally, to repeat this entire function, you just have to type the keyword and a set of parentheses and a semicolon 
                following it.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics2">
            <h4>Interactive MouseClicked Function</h4>
            <img id="image4" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rlHWN.gif" height="250px" align="left" />
            <p class="mouseClicked">
                First, in the parameters of the function that will be put into the mouseClicked function, replace all of the x and y coordinates 
                with expressions that are related to a certain starting number, but also equal the original number.  For example, if the number is 
                30, then it must be changed to 200-70, with all of the others changed to be related to that same number, 200, as well.  To write 
                out the mouseClicked function, which allows us to make the function appear on the display screen wherever the mouse is clicked 
                each time, write the keyword <em>mouseClicked</em>, followed by <em>= function( ){ }</em>.  Then, put the function that was typed 
                out previously into the curly brackets and type <em>mouseX, mouseY</em> into the parentheses of the rewritten function and 
                <em>x, y</em> into the original function containing the commands.  This means that all of the 200s, or whatever starting number 
                used in the parameters of the commands, must be replaced with x or y, depending on which variable they represented, allowing the 
                function to appear anywhere on the web page when it is clicked.
            </p>

        <h2>Programming Decisions</h2>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>My Potato Function</h3>
            <p>
                For my function, I decided on creating a potato.  I did this by using ellipses for the overall shape, eyes, and dots and by using 
                arcs for the smile and outlines.  I had to use arcs for the outline instead of stroke and strokeWeight because the ellipses had to 
                overlap to create the potato figure, and if I used stroke, there would be unwanted lines across the potato.  I decided on using 
                potatoes because they are delicious and I just overall enjoy them, like the way they look and how the word <em>potato</em> sounds.
                I also decided on putting a smiley face on the potato because it represents potatoes make me feel good inside and also because 
                happy potatoes are just better in general.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>My For Loops</h3>
            <p>
                I used for loops when creating rocks in the ground and the sky.  I originally was just going to use it for the rocks, but it ended 
                up being a part of the sky as well only because it was required, as one of my peers showed me.  I decided on making them rocks 
                because it makes the dirt seem more realistic and detailed, which makes the overall art better.  Using a for loop for the rocks 
                was an easy and efficient way of creating several various shaped rocks at once, as it would be a waste of time to create that many 
                ellipses and making the rocks all the same shape would make them seem fake and less detailed.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>My Conditional Statements</h3>
            <p>
                For my conditional statements, I ended up creating several of them, since I was attempting to make a sky with more than one shade 
                of blue.  I did this with many <em>else if</em> statements, with each one of them representing a part of the skay.  To be more 
                specific, each statement represents a rectangualar piece of the sky, in which there are a total of five.  I made it lighter by 
                subtracting 2 from both the green and blue parameters of the fill property, which had already set variables as parameters.  I 
                wanted the sky to appear lighter as it went down, and using conditional statements was an effective way of create detailed and 
                realistic skies, which I was taught by one of my classmates.

        <h2>What I've Learned and  Will Remember</h2>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>Ellipses</h3>
            <p>
                One thing that I learned that I will make sure to remember is how to create and control ellipses using the ellipse function, which 
                is ellipse( );.  I will remember how to control the ellipses by putting 4 numbers/variables into the parentheses, which are the 
                parameters.  The first number controls where the ellipse is on the web page horizontally, while the second number controls where 
                the ellipse is on the web page vertically.  The third number controls the width of the ellipse, and the fourth one controls the 
                height of the ellipse.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
            <p>
                Another thing that I learned that I will make sure to remember is how to write an if-else statement.  I will remember to include the 
                conditional in the if statement itself and 2 blocks of code: one for the if part when the conditional is true and one for the else 
                part when the conditional is false.  I will also take into consideration some examples of the blocks of code to be executed, like 
                fill, strokeWeight, and stroke and its common parameters.
            </p>

        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>For Loops</h3>
            <p>
                An additional thing that I learned that I will make sure to remember is how to write a for loop for the ellipse function, which 
                can be applied to others, as well.  I will remember the three statements that must be incorporated in the parentheses: the 
                initialization, condition, and afterthought.  I will also remember the functions that can be put into the curly brackets to be 
                looped and take into account how to put the variables into the parameters of the function that is being looped.

            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>
                Creating my own function is another thing that I learned that I will make sure to remember.  I will remember to 
                call the function with a keyword that represents that function, and I will also remember to put commands and functions into the 
                curly brackets, since they are what actually creates and contrives the object appearing on the web page using the function.  I 
                will also take into account some of the most used functions and commands that can be put into the curly brackets, like ellipse, 
                fill, and stroke, for example.

            <h3>MouseClicked Function</h3>
            <p>
                Something else that I learned that I will make sure to remember is how to use the mouseClicked function on my own functions.  I 
                will remember that they must use variables, like x and y, and that the parameters must be written with a starting point number, 
                like 200s, so that they can be replaced with the variables later on.  I will also make a note of putting the variables into the 
                parentheses of the functions, like button(mouseX, mouseY);.

            <h3>Looking up Concepts I don't Know or Remember</h3>
            <p>
                A skill that I have acquired from computer programming is looking up concepts that I don't know or remember.  Since this project 
                requires a lot of "Googling" and searching the web, I have gotten better at finding reliable resources that can quickly but clearly 
                walk me through something that I don't know, like Javascript functions, what to put into the parameters of certain functions and 
                properties, and other concepts that I don't remember how to execute.

        <h2>The Next Steps to Improvement</h2>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>Polishing and Revising Current Code</h3>
            <p>
                The first of the next steps to improvement would be going back to the code of my generative art to go through it again and make 
                sure that it is correct.  I would also read through it while looking for unused code to take away and reorganize the code so that 
                it looks neater and makes more sense to anyone who sees it.  In addition to going through the code and polishing it, I would also 
                add some little details to make the art project itself look nicer.
            </p>

        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>Learning More Concepts to Add to My Work</h3>
            <p>
                The second step would be to learn more concepts. This way, I can add more ideas to my generative art.  To do this, I will go 
                through the Javacript playlists and take what learn from the future assignments and projects to apply to my generative art.  Also, 
                I will go on the internet and go to Javascript websites, like reference websites, to try to familiarize myself with new functions, 
                commands, properties, and other concepts.

            <h3>Executing New Ideas Using New Concepts</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, the third would be to use the concepts that I just learned from the previous step and apply it to my generative art.  
                However, I would have to first come up with new ideas that will improve my generative art, like making the scenery more realistic 
                and detailed or making the overall generative art page more interactive.  Then, I will use the concepts that I just studied and 
                use it in my code to actually execute my ideas and improve my work.
