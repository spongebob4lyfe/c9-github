   <p class="giraffe">Giraffes are the best animals on the planet!  Their natural habitats are the savannahs, grasslands, and woodlands of Africa.  As you most likely already know, giraffes are extremely tall!  An average adult male can grow up to 16 to 20 feet, and average adult females are around 15 feet tall.  Their long necks help them reach their food, the leaves up in the trees, and they also have dark purple colored tongues that protect them from sunburns when they stick their tongues out to eat.  Giraffes do not only have amazing, interesting features, but they are also cuts, beautiful creatures!  <a class="link" href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/g/giraffe/">Click here to learn more about these majestic creatures!</a></p>

   <p class="spongebob">My favorite show ever created is Spongebob Squarepants!  This show is a hilarious, entertaining show for people of any age about talking sea creatures that live in a town under the sea called "Bikini Bottom."  Each of the lovable characters have their own traits and perks, which add to the character and qualities of the show.  My favorite character, for one, is Patrick Star, an adorable sea star who lives under a rock and is the best friend and neighbor of Spongebob Squarepants.  This is a MUST SEE show, and if you watch just <em>one</em> episode, you <strong>will not</strong> regret it!  <a class="link" href="https://www.infoplease.com/fast-facts-spongebob-squarepants">Click here to see some Fun Facts  about this awesome show!</a></p>
