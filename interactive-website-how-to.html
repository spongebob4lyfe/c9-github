        <h1>How I Created My Interactive Website</h1>
        
        <h2>My Creation</h2>
        <img src="https://agegapgal.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/half-plus-seven-graph1.jpg?w=604&h=653" height="300px"/>
        <p class="p">
            Using HTML and the Javascript DOM, I created an interactive website that calculates the socially appropriate age limit of whom you 
            should date based on “The Dating Equation” using your own age.  This way, people do not have to do the math equation themselves and can 
            just put in their age and press a couple of buttons to find their answer.  The website additionally displays images that show more about 
            "The Dating Equation", which reveal more information when they are clicked on.  This website solves the problem of doubting if a person 
            is able to date their partner of a different age without your relationship being viewed as socially unacceptable, and the website user 
            can easily access their solution without having to solve a math equation.

        <h2>How The Project Works Overall</h2>
        
        <h3>Programming Software and Language</h3>
        <p class="p">
            Overall, my Interactive Website functions with HTML, which is linked to a Javascript file, a coding programming language that is 
            most commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.  This allows the programmer to type up commands and code that the 
            computer can translate into a language that it understands.  Basically, a coding, or programming, language is a series of syntax rules 
            that can explain how code should be written and presented.  The language a computer uses and understands is binary code, which is code 
            made up of combinations of 0s and 1s that would take eons and an extremely advanced human mind to write out.  Therefore, we use several 
            different coding languages that we understand and can easily create, with certain languages made for certain purposes.  When we write 
            a certain command, it is first translated into assembly language, which is a low-level programming language for a computer, meaning it 
            is closer to the binary language a computer understands, unlike the high-level language mostly used today.  Then, the assembly language 
            is translated into machine language, a set of instructions that is executed directly by the CPU, the computer's central processing unit, 
            into binary code so that the computer can understand the code.
        </p>
        
        <h3>HTML</h3>

        <p class="p">
            In this case, I only used HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language, to create the website itself.  Simply put, HTML is a code that is used to 
            write and construct each and every page on the Internet.  It is constantly evolving and getting modified to meet the requirements of 
            the world and its advances, so it is always improving.  HTML consists of several short codes known as tags, which are known to be in 
            between angle brackets (<,>).  These tags allow us to easily put content into webpages and sites, since they are easy to understand 
            and can be written pretty quickly.  Each tag has a different, specific function, and the tags themselves don't appear on the page, but 
            their effects on the content do.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Javascript HTML DOM</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn.guru99.com/images/JavaScript/javascript8_1.png" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            The DOM is the Document Object Model of a webpage.  The DOM treats HTML as a tree structure containing "objects" that represent various 
            parts of the document.  The DOM is able to manipulate and change the HTML elements and their attributes through a Javacript 
            document using Javascript DOM methods.  This includes altering the CSS styles in a webpage, adding HTML elements and attributes, and 
            removing HTML elements.  Also, the Javascript DOM has the ability to make websites interactive, which allow the users to have input and 
            take actions in the websites.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Code Specifics</h2>
        
        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Input</h4>
            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HWadm1xUS4CjJYM8ShzaAA.gif" height="200px"/>
            <p>
                The input tag creates a box in the browser in which the user of the website can interact with and type in, such as in the gif above.  
                Input boxes often have a certain purpose for its users to fulfill.  For example, calculators use input boxes to record the user's 
                equations and problems so that it could then solve it.  Inputs are also commonly paired with buttons or some other form of s
                ubmitting the data within the input box so that the information could be processed, like how there is an equal or enter sign on a 
                calculater to process each equation typed. Input tags are also a great way to make a website interactive and more interesting for 
                its users, as long as they are made interactive using Javascript DOM elements.  Input tags do not have an end tag, but they do 
                require a slash to be at the end of the tag, just before the closing angle bracket.
