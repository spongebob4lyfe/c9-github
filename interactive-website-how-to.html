        <h1>How I Created My Interactive Website</h1>
        
        <h2>My Creation</h2>
        <img src="https://agegapgal.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/half-plus-seven-graph1.jpg?w=604&h=653" height="300px"/>
        <p class="p">
            Using HTML and the Javascript DOM, I created an interactive website that calculates the socially appropriate age limit of whom you 
            should date based on “The Dating Equation” using your own age.  This way, people do not have to do the math equation themselves and can 
            just put in their age and press a couple of buttons to find their answer.  The website additionally displays images that show more about 
            "The Dating Equation", which reveal more information when they are clicked on.  This website solves the problem of doubting if a person 
            is able to date their partner of a different age without your relationship being viewed as socially unacceptable, and the website user 
            can easily access their solution without having to solve a math equation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How The Project Works Overall</h2>
        
        <h3>Programming Software and Language</h3>
        <p class="p">
            Overall, my Interactive Website functions with HTML, which is linked to a Javascript file, a coding programming language that is 
            most commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.  This allows the programmer to type up commands and code that the 
            computer can translate into a language that it understands.  Basically, a coding, or programming, language is a series of syntax rules 
            that can explain how code should be written and presented.  The language a computer uses and understands is binary code, which is code 
            made up of combinations of 0s and 1s that would take eons and an extremely advanced human mind to write out.  Therefore, we use several 
            different coding languages that we understand and can easily create, with certain languages made for certain purposes.  When we write 
            a certain command, it is first translated into assembly language, which is a low-level programming language for a computer, meaning it 
            is closer to the binary language a computer understands, unlike the high-level language mostly used today.  Then, the assembly language 
            is translated into machine language, a set of instructions that is executed directly by the CPU, the computer's central processing unit, 
            into binary code so that the computer can understand the code.
        </p>
        
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/HTML.svg/1200px-HTML.svg.png" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            In this case, I only used HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language, to create the website itself.  Simply put, HTML is a code that is used to 
            write and construct each and every page on the Internet.  It is constantly evolving and getting modified to meet the requirements of 
            the world and its advances, so it is always improving.  HTML consists of several short codes known as tags, which are known to be in 
            between angle brackets (<,>).  These tags allow us to easily put content into webpages and sites, since they are easy to understand 
            and can be written pretty quickly.  Each tag has a different, specific function, and the tags themselves don't appear on the page, but 
            their effects on the content do.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Javascript HTML DOM</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn.guru99.com/images/JavaScript/javascript8_1.png" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            The DOM is the Document Object Model of a webpage.  The DOM treats HTML as a tree structure containing "objects" that represent various 
            parts of the document.  The DOM is able to manipulate and change the HTML elements and their attributes through a Javacript 
            document using Javascript DOM methods.  This includes altering the CSS styles in a webpage, adding HTML elements and attributes, and 
            removing HTML elements.  Also, the Javascript DOM has the ability to make websites interactive, which allow the users to have input and 
            take actions in the websites.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Code Specifics</h2>
        
        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Input</h4>
            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HWadm1xUS4CjJYM8ShzaAA.gif" height="200px"/>
            <p>
                The input tag creates a box in the browser in which the user of the website can interact with and type in, such as in the gif above.  
                Input boxes often have a certain purpose for its users to fulfill.  For example, calculators use input boxes to record the user's 
                equations and problems so that it could then solve it.  Inputs are also commonly paired with buttons or some other form of s
                ubmitting the data within the input box so that the information could be processed, like how there is an equal or enter sign on a 
                calculater to process each equation typed. Input tags are also a great way to make a website interactive and more interesting for 
                its users, as long as they are made interactive using Javascript DOM elements.  Input tags do not have an end tag, but they do 
                require a slash to be at the end of the tag, just before the closing angle bracket.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Select</h4>
            <img id="image" src="https://jonsuh.com/assets/images/blog/2014/convert-loop-through-json-php-javascript-arrays-objects/dynamic-select.gif" height="200px">
            <p>
                The select tag creates a drop-down list or menu containing several options.  Specifically, the select tag is used the create the 
                drop-down list layout itself that can be clicked to have its options drop down.  Option tags must be used within the select element 
                to display the various options that drop down in the list, and the name of each list item is defined between its two parts of the 
                tag.  To make the website have certain effects when certain options are chosen, they are often made interactive using conditionals 
                and if-else statements along with DOM methods in Javascript.  This allows the website to have various results to each option that is 
                clicked on, giving the user more interaction.  Additionally, when typing each option into a conditional, they must be in quotations 
                and be written <em>exactly</em> as they are in the HTML option tags for it to work.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Button</h4>
            <img  src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q57ttFIU21w/WL9--uYtf-I/AAAAAAAALfU/oleKXAVd_cEcJ_L_LLOv4ZmebvQMoTHPwCLcB/s1600/test4.gif" height="180px"/>
            <p>
                The button tag creates a user clickable button in a webpage.  The buttons themselves can be styled through CSS, so that 
                it instead has a more unique look than the default button appearance.  To make a button have text or a description on top of it, such as 
                "enter" or "calculate", the text must be typed between the two pieces of the button tag, and it will appear above the button.  The 
                descriptions are often used to briefly explain the function of the button.  Buttons are made functional and purposeful with the DOM 
                so that there can be an affect to clicking it, like adding style or content to the website.  Many times, buttons are used to submit 
                certain content, such as data from within an input box typed in by the user. This allows the user to obtain results from clicking the 
                button.  One common example of this combination would be a search engine, like <em>Google</em>.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Javascript HTML DOM Methods and Elements</h3>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>getElementById()</h4>
            <img src="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/head-first-html5/9781449314712/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2224176.png.jpg" height="140px"/>
            <p>
                The getElementById method is one of te most used methods in the DOM.  It is used each time a programmer wants to manipulate, change, 
                or get information from an HTML element.  The getElementById() DOM method works in the Javascript file by using the id an HTML 
                element is assigned to and looking for the same id in the HTML file it is linked to from top to bottom.  Once the getElementById 
                method finds the id in the HTML file, it takes the element that contains the id and brings all of its information, such as position 
                and color, and moves it back to the Javascript file so that there, it can be changed and modified.  The DOM method works with id 
                name located in the parentheses within quotes, and it is often set to a variable so that it could be used to modify the HTML element 
                directly through the Javascript file.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>addEventListener</h4>
            <img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/active/uploads/legacy/flashtuts/074_EventListenersBasics/1.jpg" height="180px"/>
            <p>
                The addEventListener method works by listening for a specified event, such as "click", and runs a function once it pursues the 
                event, and the function run is often anonymous, but is not always.  The addEventListener method begins with a variable, where the 
                method listens for for an event to occur, such as a button.  The addEventListener then has the certain event stated in quotes and 
                parentheses, followed by a comma to separate the event from the function.  The function run then causes a specific change or 
                manipulation to occur, depending on what variable is stated in the function and what the function does to that variable as a result 
                of an event occurring.  
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>innerHTML</h4>
            <img src="http://slideplayer.com/11908398/67/images/21/innerHTML+Example+%3C%21DOCTYPE+html%3E+%3Chtml%3E+%3Cbody%3E.jpg" height="200px"/>
            <p>
                The Javascript DOM innerHTML property allows the programmer to directly add to or change HTML content of an element through a 
                Javascript file.  The innerHTML property works by having the variable name of the element being affected typed just before 
                .innerHTML.  This is then set to the content being added to the element.  This content must be in parentheses if it is text that is 
                being put into the website exactly as it is typed in between the quotes, but it does not have to if the content being added or 
                changed is similar to an equation.  If this is the case, then the solution to the equation is put into the webpage instead of the 
                equation itself.

        <h2>Programming Decisions</h2>
        
        <div class="wil">
            <h3>Id and Variable Names</h3>
            <p>
                I made many decisions regarding id and variable names during the process of creating my interactive website.  For id names, I 
                decided on naming them for what the element represents.  For example, for the button, I named the id calculate, since the button 
                calculates the solution to the equation and the word "Calculate" is displayed on the button itself.  For variable names, I decided 
                on naming the variables exactly the same as the id names of the elements stored in the variables so that I could remember what each 
                variable is for without getting confused as to knowing which variable goes to which HTML element.

            <h3>Topic: The Dating Equation</h3>
            <p>
                For my interactive website, I decided on basing it on "The Dating Equation" because it allowed me to use all of the required 
                components of the project meaningfully.  For example, I was able to use a conditional, function, getElementById, eventListener, 
                input, and innerHTML for just the equations, which already used almost half of the requirements.  This made it easier to 
                include everything while understanding what I am programming and making interactive at the same time. I am also able to provide 
                images that reveal more information about the topic using even more of the requirements and coding components.

        <h2>How This Project Has Developed My Connection to and Understanding of Programmed Interactions</h2>
        
        <img src="http://guyhaas.com/bfoit/itp/images/Programming_Wordle.jpg" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            This project has developed my understanding of programmed interactions by allowing me to create code that makes websites interactive.  
            By practicing this hands on experience, I am able to connect with interactions very closely.  I now know how to make HTML elements 
            interactive using eventListeners, which make elements change through running a function as an affect an event or interaction made by the 
            user, such as clicking a button or putting input into a website.  I also understand that making a website interactive allows the users 
            to have more of a first hand experience, where they get to learn through completing their own actions with the support and guidance of 
            what the website provides.
        </p>
    
        <h2>One Thing I Would Change or Improve About My Interactive Website</h2>
        
        <img src="https://www.baboon.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hover1.gif"/>
        <p class="p">
            If I had more time, one thing I would change or improve about my interactive website would be making the input box, select drop-down 
            list, and button larger and better looking.  Currently, all three components of the website look somewhat unprofessional compared to the 
            rest of the webpage, as they are all plain, simple, and small and unproportional to the size of the rest of the website elements.  I 
            would want to make my button have style, similarly to the one above.  Additionally, I would also want to make the other two elements 
            look as good as what the button would be like, but I would also want to make them match the theme of the overall website, which is 
            shades of white, gray, and black. Finally, I would do all of this by using CSS styling through the Javascript HTML DOM.
