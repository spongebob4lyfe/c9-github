        <h1>How I Created My "About Me" Webpage</h1>
        
        <h2>My Creation</h2>
        <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/7/7c/Imagination%21.gif/revision/latest?cb=20160426044127" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            In my "About Me and What I've Learned" webpage, I created it based on myself and my several interests.  It includes my attributes, hobbies, 
            and the things I like or enjoy doing.  I also designed the page so that its style corresponds with my own taste and personality.  In addition, 
            the page includes what I have learned about HTML and CSS and other skills I have developed over the course of this computer programming 
            experience in the form of lists.  Basically, I am just giving an overview of who I am using a combination of detailed descriptions, lists, 
            images, and fun gifs.  The only limit is my <em>IMAGINATION</em>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How The Project Works Overall</h2>
        
        <h3>Programming Software and Language</h3>
        <p class="p">
            Overall, my "about Me and What I've Learned" page functions with a coding program that understands several programming languages.  This 
            allows the programmer to type up instructions and code that the computer can translate into a language that it understands.  Basically, a 
            coding, or programming, language is a series of syntax rules that can explain how code should be written and presented.  The language a 
            computer uses and understands is binary code, which is code made up of combinations of 0s and 1s that would take eons and an extremely 
            advanced human mind to write out.  Therefore, we use several different coding languages that we understand and can easily create, with 
            certain languages made for certain purposes.  When we write a certain command, it is first translated into assembly language, which is a 
            low-level programming language for a computer, meaning it is closer to the binary language a computer understands, unlike the high-level 
            language mostly used today.  Then, the assembly language is translated into machine language, a set of instructions that is executed directly 
            by the CPU, the computer's central processing unit, into binary code so that the computer can understand the code.
        </p>
        
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/HTML.svg/1200px-HTML.svg.png" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            I used HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language, to place content related to myself on my "About Me" webpage, using several different tags to add various ideas 
            and visuals.  Simply put, HTML is a code that is used to write and construct each and every page on the Internet.  It is constantly evolving 
            and getting modified to meet the requirements of the world and its advances, so it is always improving.  HTML consists of several short 
            codes known as tags, which are known to be in between angle brackets (<,>).  These tags allow us to easily put content into webpages and 
            sites, since they are easy to understand and can be written pretty quickly.  Each tag has a different, specific function, and the tags 
            themselves don't appear on the page, but their effects on the content do.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/CSS-shade.svg/1200px-CSS-shade.svg.png" height="250px"/>
        <p class="p">
            I used CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, to design and "beautify" my "About Me" page, linking a CSS file to my HTML file so that I could add style 
            to my page more quickly and easily from the CSS file, instead of just putting CSS elements into my HTML file, which would take forever and 
            would make the structure of my page less appealing and sophisticated.  CSS is basically a style language that sets up and formats the overall 
            layout and design of the webpage.  CSS relies on divs, class, id, and curly brackets in order to function correctly.  It also has certain 
            explicit terms that must be typed correctly in order to serve its purpose, which may be positioning, coloring, or changing the size of an 
            item, depending on what the term is.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Code Specifics</h2>
        
        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Headings</h4>
            <img id="image" src="http://www.madrasgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Heading-Tags.jpg" height="150px"/>
            <p>
                There are six sizes of headings, with six similar numbered heading tags shown in the image above.  The 'h' stands for heading, 
                followed by a number that defines its size.  The lower the number is, the bigger the size, so the most important headings should be 
                the largest, thus they would use a heading tag with a low number.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
            <img id="image" src="http://code4beginner.com/images/Html/HTML-Paragraph-Tag-1.png" height="150px">
            <p>
                The paragraph tag, shown in the image above, is for putting text into a webpage.  The 'p' in the paragraph tag stands for paragraph, 
                and between the opening and closing tags is where the content should be written.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Unordered Lists</h4>
            <img id="image2" src="http://powertoearnmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ListsUnordered.jpg" height="100px"/>
            <p>
                This is an unordered list, which uses the tags on the left side of the image above and looks like the right side of the image. 'ul' 
                stands for unordered list, and 'li' stands for list item.  This means that each of the items are organized with bullet points, not 
                numbers.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Ordered Lists</h4>
            <img id="image2" src="http://powertoearnmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ListsOrdered.jpg" height="100px"/>
            <p>
                This is an ordered list, which uses the lags on the left side of the image above and looks like the right side of the image.  'ol' 
                stands for ordered list, and 'li' stands for list item.  This means that each of the items are numbered, instead of being organized 
                with bullet points.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Nested Lists</h4>
            <img id="image2" src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/nestedlists-160529154000/95/nested-lists-in-html-6-638.jpg?cb=1464536505" height="250px"/>
            <p>
                This is a nested list.  As you can see in the image above, there is an ordered list within another ordered list.  One set of the 
                ordered list tags is placed in between another st of ordered list tags, making it so that there is a numbered list within another 
                numbered list.  One set of list items is inside an original set of list items.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Images</h4>

            <p>
                To display an image on the webpage, an image tag is used.  There is no closing tag, just a slash before the last angle bracket.  
                First, the image address is placed in the quotations after 'src=' so that the image could be identified, like in the image above.  
                Then, after 'alt=' a description of the image is written, mainly for those who cannot see the image, or if the image won't show, 
                also shown in the picture above.  Finally, although it is not shown above, there is a height and/or width attribute for controlling 
                the size of an image.  Ex.:  height="200px"
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Hyperlinks</h4>
            <img id="image2" src="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/html-tag.gif" height="100px"/>
            <p>
                Above is an image of a tag meant for displaying a hyperlink onto a webpage.  In the opening tag, after the 'a', which stands for 
                anchor, the link is placed in the quotes after 'href='.  Then, after the opening tag, any name the link will be under must be 
                written, followed by the closing tag.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Divs</h4>
            <img id="image" src="https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/hajan/postimages2010/jQueryTemplates/jQuery-templates-tags4.png" height="150px"/>
            <p>
                The div tag is used to define a certain section of a webpage.  It can group several different sections together, mainly for being 
                styled with CSS.  This tag is mostly used with CSS and accompanied with class and/or id.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Class and Id</h4>
            <img id="image" src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/html-css-session-140205051802-phpapp01/95/html-css-basics-44-638.jpg?cb=1391577692" height="120px"/>
            <p>
                Class and Id are often used with divs, used for applying an item or a group of items to one or more attributes.  To identify certain 
                classes and ids in CSS, they are named.  Ex.:  class="item1"  However, although class is similar to id, they are still different.  
                Class usually applies to several elements, while id is used when CSS is applied to one attribute only.
            </p>

        <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>

            <h4>Linking CSS to HTML</h4>
            <img id="image3" src="https://digicompdiy.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pic2.jpg" height="150px"/>
            <p>
                The tag above shows how to link a CSS file to an HTML file, which allows for styling a webpage from a separate file, which makes CSS 
                much faster and easier.  First a CSS file must be created for the HTML file.  The link tag doesn't have a closing tag, just a slash 
                before the closing angle bracket.  After 'link' is written, type 'rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="".  This defines a CSS file, 
                so in the quotations after 'href=', place in the name of the CSS file (cssfilename.css).
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>CSS Syntax</h4>
            <img id="image" src="http://cssvideos.com/images/videos/css-syntax-diagram.gif" height="150px"/>
            <p>
                CSS syntax is the format used for styling in CSS.  Like in the image above, there must first be the selector, which may be the whole 
                'body' or just a class or id name of a div.  Basically, it is just anything that will be styled.  After that is the declaration block, 
                which is between two curly brackets and consists of the property and the value.  The property is the part of the selector that will be 
                modified, and the value is what it will be changed to.  For example, the property can be 'background-color', and the value would be the 
                color the background will be, like 'blue' or 'green'.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h4>Class and Id</h4>
            <img id="image" src="https://dhananjay25.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/image67.png" height="150px"/>
            <p>
                If an item has a class or id, then that means that it will probably be styled in CSS.  The name of a class in CSS would have a '.' 
                in front of it, while the name of an id would have a '#' in front of it.  As it says above, class can be applied to several sections, 
                while id can only be applied to one.  Since class and id are usually in divs, if CSS is applied to a class or id, the sections 
                grouped into the div that have a certain class or id will be affected by CSS and will be styled.
            </p>

            <h4>Colors</h4>
            <img id="image2" src="https://img.webnots.com/2017/02/CSS-Color-Text-Box-Widget.png" height="200px"/>
            <p>
                One of the most modified properties is color.  Mostly everything on a webpage can have various colors, whether it is the background, 
                borders, or the text itself.  In addition, not only can background be a color, it can also be an image, as long as the URL of the 
                image is put into the value section after 'url' and in between two parenthesis.  Some examples of properties for color change are 
                'color:', 'background-color', or 'border-color'.

            <p>
                Padding, Borders, and Margins are mainy used for positioning and looks.  The size of padding and margins can be changed to create 
                space between two items so that they are not all compact together, which isn't very appealing.  They can also be used for 
                positioning.  For example, modifying the padding of an image inside a border can move it to the center, left, right, up , or down, 
                depending on where the size of the padding is changed.

        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>
                For my "About Me" page, I made choices when putting content into my webpage.  I decided to write a small introduction excerpt about 
                myself and then organize my main interests into lists.  For my three main interests, I included images and gifs based on the top 
                five items in each list to make the page more interesting, while not having too many images.  I also included an image of the eiffel 
                tower in the bottom right corner, since I've always wanted to go to Paris, and also because there was a random blank space in the
                corner and I wanted to fill it in. For the things that I learned, I organized it into topics of HTML, CSS, and other skills I have 
                acquired.  Finally, I put in a hyperlink that goes directly to this "How-To" page for convenience.
            </p>

        <div class="code-specifics">
            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <p>
                For all the colors on my "About Me" page, I mainly chose a black and white theme.  I chose to make the background black and the text 
                and borders white because it stands out against the dark background, and it also has a professional, modern feel to it.  The only 
                text that is not white is the hyperlink, which is purple so that it stands out as a link.  The only other items that have colors 
                other than black or white are the backgrounds of the two 'h2' headings and the introduction.  I chose the backgrounds of the two 
                headings to be purple, since it is my favorite color, and I wanted to put a bit of a twist corresponding to my personality on my 
                formal-looking page.  I made the background of my introduction purple giraffe print from an image, since I mentioned that I LOVE 
                purple giraffes in the introduction.  All the other colors come from the images and gifs I included for appeal.

            <p>
                For my "About Me" page, I organized my content into borders to make it neat, and I formatted the page to look as symmetrical as 
                possible, since I'm a little bit OCD.  For my three main interests, I made my lists and then placed my images in under them, 
                changing the sizes so that the borders of each of the lists and their images are the same size.  In the CSS I used 'vertical-align: 
                top;' to align everything at the top, instead of the bottom, which made it look much better.  I also tried to fill the page from 
                left to right by modifying the width of each item so that there weren't any gaps or blank spaces.  In addition, I made the margins 
                and padding larger so that the items are evenly spaced out without looking too dense.

                Examples of attributes I will most likely use again are background-color, background-image, color, text-align, border-style, padding,

                requires a lot of "Googling" and searching the web, I have gotten better at finding reliable resources that can quickly but clearly
